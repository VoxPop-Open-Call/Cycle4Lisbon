          Cycle for Lisbon is a mobile application available for download on
          Apple Store and Google Play. The App is designed for both Lisbon
          residents and tourists and allows users to select an initiative to
          support. Each kilometer traveled by bike using the App is converted
          into in-app credits, which can be used to support the selected
          initiative. The App also registers trip details such as distance,
          time, and coins earned and presents the top 5 users in a leaderboard.
          Cycle for Lisbon aims to be a platform where NGOs and Institutions can
          share their social projects, known as &quot;Initiatives,&quot; and
          receive direct support from the community. Each Initiative has the
          support of sponsors who convert the in-app coins into real money and
          donate it to the responsible institutions.
